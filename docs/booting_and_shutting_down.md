# Booting
1. Make sure toggle switch is set to normal mode and led is red.
2. Press push button for 1sec. You will notice led starts blinking red which means FloEdge is booting up.
3. When the led becomes green, it means FloEdge has booted.

# Shutting down
1. Press push button for 1sec. You will notice led starts blinking red from green which means FloEdge is shutting down.
2. When led stops blinking (i.e. solid red), it means FloEdge is off.
